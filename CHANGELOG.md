## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **People link out** — clicking any author/actor name opens a redirect menu of their
  IMDb · TMDB · TheTVDB · Wikipedia · Open Library pages, auto-resolved on first open
  (`POST /people/lookup`, Wikipedia via Wikidata); a **People console** under Metadata
  lists everyone referenced in the library with link status, per-row and bulk fetch
  (`GET /people/names`)
- **Fetch-metadata progress bar** — `POST /covers/refetch` is chunked (cursor/limit →
  next_cursor/done/total/remaining); the Metadata page loops chunks and shows real progress
- Import promoted into the primary nav (desktop topbar + mobile bottom bar)
- Mobile filter sheets: labeled full-width controls with a shared Reset · count · Done footer;
  Library gained its missing mobile add-book entry
- Tags page: New-tag and New-sticker add-cards lead the page (2 columns on desktop)

### Changed
- **Hi-res covers** — TMDB stored posters use `original` (thumbnails stay w342), Google Books
  covers upgraded via `fife` renders, Amazon size modifier dropped for full-size scans; cover
  fetch cap raised to 5 MB (upload envelope 6 MB)
- Library page header retitled "Books"; brand mark enlarged to match the nav icons
- Add-annotation/dialogue box moved above the list on detail pages
- The read-only demo now ships realistic fixtures (covers, stickers, people links) and honours
  detail-page filters, search scopes, and search group-by

### Fixed
- OpenLibrary covers never stored (their `archive.org` redirect targets were rejected by the
  SSRF allowlist); TheTVDB posters never stored (`artworks.thetvdb.com` missing from the allowlist)
- Mobile annotation cards overflowing the viewport; sticky page bar floating below the top of
  the screen; five nav tabs now fit a 320 px viewport

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Spaced repetition — daily review** (roadmap №2): a Daily Review card on the new Home screen
  resurfaces your own highlights on a forgetting-curve schedule — per-annotation memory half-life,
  recall probability decaying in SQL at query time (no jobs, no cron), *Got it / Forgot / skip*
  answers, mastery (soon / later / someday), a timezone-aware daily deck capped at 8 cards, and a
  pending-review dot on the logo and drawer. `GET /annotations/daily-review` +
  `POST /annotations/{id}/review`; review state lives in its own table (migration 0013) so edits
  and heart-toggles never disturb the schedule
- **Home screen** — date + greeting, the Daily Review card, a quick-capture tile, book/film stat
  tiles, and the two most recent favourites; it is the landing view (`/`) on desktop and mobile,
  reached any time by tapping the logo
- **Quick capture** — a ＋ in the mobile top bar (and the Home tile everywhere) opens a
  capture sheet: book, quote, note, chapter/location, comma-separated tags, colour
- **PWA install** — web app manifest + generated icons (incl. maskable), `viewport-fit=cover`,
  safe-area insets on the shell bars and full-screen sheets, theme-colour meta
- Toast feedback primitive (ink-on-cream pill); wired on capture, review, and sign-in
- `GET /annotations` rows now carry `book_title` / `book_author` for cross-book lists
- **People link out** — clicking any author/actor name opens a redirect menu of their
  IMDb · TMDB · TheTVDB · Wikipedia · Open Library pages, auto-resolved on first open
  (`POST /people/lookup`, Wikipedia via Wikidata); a **People console** under Metadata
  lists everyone referenced in the library with link status, per-row and bulk fetch
  (`GET /people/names`)
- **Fetch-metadata progress bar** — `POST /covers/refetch` is chunked (cursor/limit →
  next_cursor/done/total/remaining); the Metadata page loops chunks and shows real progress
- Import promoted into the primary nav
- Mobile filter sheets: labeled full-width controls with a shared Reset · count · Done footer;
  Library gained its missing mobile add-book entry
- Tags page: New-tag and New-sticker add-cards lead the page (2 columns on desktop)

### Changed
- **Mobile shell** — primary navigation moved from the bottom tab bar to a hamburger **drawer**
  (nav + counts + account + log out); a slim sticky top bar carries ☰ · logo → Home · ＋ capture ·
  search · avatar, and detail screens swap it for their own back + title bar
- The **start-page setting is retired** (Home is the start page); stored `home` preference keys
  and older clients still sending one are ignored
- **Hi-res covers** — TMDB stored posters use `original` (thumbnails stay w342), Google Books
  covers upgraded via `fife` renders, Amazon size modifier dropped for full-size scans; cover
  fetch cap raised to 5 MB (upload envelope 6 MB)
- Library page header retitled "Books"; brand mark enlarged to match the nav icons
- Add-annotation/dialogue box moved above the list on detail pages
- The read-only demo now ships realistic fixtures (covers, stickers, people links) and honours
  detail-page filters, search scopes, and search group-by — and its daily-review deck is
  playable (session-only)

### Removed
- Bottom navigation bar and the Settings "Start page" toggle (superseded by the drawer + Home)

### Fixed
- OpenLibrary covers never stored (their `archive.org` redirect targets were rejected by the
  SSRF allowlist); TheTVDB posters never stored (`artworks.thetvdb.com` missing from the allowlist)
- Mobile annotation cards overflowing the viewport; sticky page bar floating below the top of
  the screen; five nav tabs now fit a 320 px viewport

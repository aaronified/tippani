# screen — the go/push race jsdom cannot reproduce. Nothing here touches a real data dir.

# Seeding is not optional, and for a different reason than the scroll probe's: a
# chip with no cast row behind it is drawn and says so with aria-disabled, so an
# unseeded run finds no live door to press and reports SKIP rather than ok.
